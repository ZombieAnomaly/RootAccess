**RootAccess** is an online hacking simulation game with a focus on *scripting your own maleware*. Set in a not so distant future you play the role of an aspiring 'hacker' determined to make your mark! Will you code for good, selling protection software to make your name? Maybe you'll be a mercenary working for the highest bidder? Or perhabs you'd just like to see the world burn right after you steal everyones sensitive data?

**RootAccess does NOT condone any real hacking. All data is genrated virtually in game and any mention of 'hacking' is game related. Remember, RootAccess is just that, a game!**
